## üéì About Course

### üéØ Goals

1. Previously, I mostly maintained my own private repositories. Through this course, I aim to **gain hands-on experience with real open-source collaboration workflows** ‚Äî including *issues, pull requests, and code reviews* ‚Äî and to **improve my Git skills, documentation writing, and code style** from a *team-oriented perspective*.

2. I plan to **develop personal projects** in areas that interest me. They don‚Äôt have to be large-scale at the beginning ‚Äî for example, building and maintaining a personal blog could be a good start ‚Äî but I want to **stay consistent** and keep practicing and improving.

3. I also hope to **fork open-source projects** on GitHub that I find inspiring, **study their source code carefully**, and, whenever possible, **make meaningful contributions** to them.

### ‚ú® Expectations

1. Although the course schedule is relatively limited, I sincerely hope there will be **more practical sessions**, where we can work together and gain real collaborative experience.

2. Since class hours are short, I also hope the course can **provide more useful resources and reference links**, helping us broaden our horizons, explore new tools, and continue **self-learning after class**.

3. Many high-quality courses maintain their own websites, compiling *slides, videos, notes, and assignments/labs across semesters*. We already have platforms like *‚ÄúXuezai Xidian‚Äù*, so I hope this course can also **integrate its materials systematically** and gradually build its own **knowledge structure and logical framework** over time.

## üîç Interests

1. At Xidian University, there are many talented student developers whose open-source projects have greatly benefited our campus community. For example, **[Traintime PDA](https://github.com/BenderBlog/traintime_pda)** and **[XDUClassVideoDownloader](https://github.com/lsy223622/XDUClassVideoDownloader)**. These projects are inspiring because they **address real-world needs** and demonstrate how open-source development can directly improve students‚Äô daily experiences.  

2. This semester, I‚Äôm also taking a Database Systems course, which sparked my curiosity about open-source database technologies, especially modern HTAP and Vector Model DBMSs. I‚Äôm interested in projects such as **[SingleStore](https://github.com/singlestore-labs)** and **[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)**. These systems sit at the intersection of **data management and artificial intelligence**, and I find their architecture and performance optimization very fascinating.  

3. In addition, I‚Äôve learned about RoboMaster activities, which introduced me to the world of robotics. Since then, I‚Äôve become interested in: **robotics frameworks** such as ROS 2, **embedded systems** based on Raspberry Pi, **computer vision** libraries like **[OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)** and **[Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)**, I believe combining these technologies can lead to creative and impactful robotics projects.  

4. Recently, the topic of **AI Agents** has been gaining huge attention. I find open-source projects such as **[claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** particularly exciting because they explore how large language models can be integrated into practical development workflows. I‚Äôm also exploring ways to **build small plugins or assistants** myself ‚Äî for instance, I‚Äôve been using and studying **[obsidian-copilot](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot)**, an AI-powered plugin for the note-taking app *Obsidian*. These experiences motivate me to keep learning how to connect **AI tools, personal productivity, and open-source collaboration**.
